This project pertains to Assignment 6 of The Data Scientist's Toolbox delivered through UBC Extended Learning. The data presented here was provided by the course facilitators to practice best practices in file naming and project folder structure. The project also contains an environment.yaml file named project-env that can be used to run the report file.
